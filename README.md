## Quote Translator

A small mobile first application that allows the user to get or enter a random quote and translate it to a "language" of their choice selected from a menu system

## User Story and Accepance Crieria
as a user who needs to have quirky and unique, I want to translate my own text or generate a random quote and have it translated to either pirate speak, cockney, old english, sweedish chef (from the muppets), or THE LAST ONE, so that I can view these translations at any time, even after I have closed the window. 

### API's used"

Quote API to generate text to be translated if the user does not what to input thier own text

Fun Translations API as the source of the translations

Moment.JS API to keep track of the time, as the user can only make  5 translation requests per hour at Fun Translations

### CSS Framework 
This application uses Materialize as its style framework. Using the grid system to set up the page, the built in color's for style, as well as using Materialize's modal code to have additional functionality to the page without taking up vertical space when on Desktop, allowing the app to transition from Mobile to Desktop smoothly. 

### A Mobile First & Interactive Design 
This app was built with the Mobile Friendly design, the textareas are colored to be easier to indentify the different areas of the the app, and stacked vertically so that the user can interact easily. The last 'row' / text area that displays the users translations is transformed into a modal that pops up and dispaears in order to keep the desktop version readable and easy to use as well.
